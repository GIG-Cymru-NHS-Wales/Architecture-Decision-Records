# 0002 - Format ADRs using plaintext Markdown

**Status**: proposed  
**Date**: 2025-03-22 
**Governance**: Drafted for DHCW Technical Design Authority (TDA) for approval

## Situation - Context and Problem Statement

* We want to record architecture related decisions for NHS Wales organisations, made via agreed governance mechanisms. 
* The **structure** is decided by [ADR 0001](adr-0001-use-adrs.md)
* We need to agree the **format**.

## Background - Decision Drivers

* We want the format to be simple and easy to publish on the internet.
* We want the format to support 'formatting' e.g. headings, bold, italics, lists.
* We don't want any proprietory tools to be required to contribute ADRs.
* We want to align with industry standards (not reinvent the wheel).
* We want the selected format to be easily adopted.

## Assessment - Considered Options

* [Markdown](https://commonmark.org/)
* [Microsoft DOCX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Office_Open_XML)
* [Open Document] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDocument_technical_specification)
* No format â€“ just plaintext

## Recommendation - Decision Outcome

Format ADRs as plaintext Markdown documents, using the CommonMark specification.

* Allows for ADRs to be created and edited in any text editor, no specific software needed.
* Markdown is easy to learn.
* Markdown supports the basic formatting we need (bold, italics, headings, lists etc.) 
* Due to the limitations, it guides us to keep things simple (KISS) and easy to read.
* The CommonMark standard for Markdown is supported by GitHub and many other tools, so widely supported.

### Consequences

* This does require some learning as most staff are familiar with DOCX/Word and may have limited experience of Markdown.
* Markdown limits the formatting of the document (can be seen as a positive) so users may be constrained in presenting information.
