# GIG Cymru / NHS Wales - Architecture Decision Records

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architecture decision made along with its context and consequences.

## Introduction

* [Why write architecture decision records - By GitHub Engineering](https://github.blog/engineering/architecture-optimization/why-write-adrs/)

* [A practical overview on Architecture Decision Records: How to start and why this could be your most valuable action as a software architect](https://ctaverna.github.io/adr/)

## First Decisions

Our first decisions are for [DHCW](https://https://dhcw.nhs.wales/) to utilise achitecture decision records, specify how we will name them and agree the format:

* [Use Architecture Decision Records and Structure](design-authority\dhcw\use-architecture-decision-records-and-structure.md)
* [Architecture Decision Records Naming Convention](design-authority\dhcw\architecture-decision-records-naming-conventions.md)
* [Format Architecture Decision Records using plaintext Markdown](design-authority\dhcw\format-architecture-decision-records-with-markdown.md)
* [Use Material for MkDocs for Publishing](design-authority\dhcw\use-material-for-mkdocs-for-publishing.md)

## Creating a new record

To create a new record:

* Create a branch from ``main`` see [naming conventions](design-authority\dhcw\architecture-decision-records-naming-conventions.md)
* Make a copy of [the template](design-authority\dhcw\architecture-decision-record-template.md).
* Enter as much detail as you can in the record
* Create a [Pull Request](https://github.com/GIG-Cymru-NHS-Wales/Architecture-Decision-Records/pulls) on GitHub.com
