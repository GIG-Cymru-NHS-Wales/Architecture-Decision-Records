# Architecture Principles

## Introduction

Our principles are developed and approved by the DHCW Technical Design
Authority (TDA). Our architecture principles define how technologies should be
designed and delivered across NHS Wales. They must be adopted when building
and procuring technical solutions.

Principles apply across various contexts, technologies, and systems and are
stable over time, even as specific technologies or situations change.

Our principles help us make consistent choices when faced with new or ambiguous
situations where detailed rules may not exist or apply. They provide a
'compass' rather than a detailed 'map'.

To ensure that digital systems applications and services are aligned to health
and care strategy, complying with these principles should form part of the
governance for technical solutions, alongside architectural decision records
and defined interoperability standards.

The principles are a guide for decision making, there will be circumstances
where a trade-off needs to be made between strict adherence with the principles
and other considerations.

The rationale for not complying with the principles should be documented, for
example through an architectural decision record. To the greatest extent
possible, there should be an understanding of the route to compliance, and a
target timetable to compliance.

These principles have been derived from the [NHS England Architecture Principles January 2021 v4](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/architecture/principles).
They also reflect the [Digital Service Standards for Wales](https://digitalpublicservices.gov.wales/guidance-and-standards/digital-service-standards-wales)
published by the Centre for Digital Public Services.
